description: Run and debug BOTH Concertable E2E layers end to end — the API E2E suite (xUnit, full Aspire stack, no browser) and the UI E2E suite (Reqnroll + Playwright) — diagnosing and fixing every failure across both, lowest layer first. Use whenever the user wants a complete E2E sweep ("run all the E2E tests", "debug E2E", "are the E2E tests green", "full E2E pass"), or when a UI scenario fails and you want to confirm whether the root cause is actually in the backend event flow. Runs the API layer first (CI gates the UI job on it), so backend bugs are found and fixed before the slower browser suite runs. For just one layer, use `e2e-api-debug` or `e2e-ui-debug`; for a fast no-regression check use `e2e-ui-regress`.

# e2e-debug

The umbrella E2E debugging skill. Concertable has **two** full-stack E2E suites over the same backend:

1. **API E2E** (xUnit + Aspire `DistributedApplication`, no browser) — drives services over HTTP, polls real DB + Stripe state until the async event chain settles. Proves the **service-layer flows**. → mechanics in **`e2e-api-debug`**.
2. **UI E2E** (Reqnroll + Playwright, real browser) — drives the SPAs, proves the **user-facing flows** on top of that same backend. → mechanics in **`e2e-ui-debug`**.

This skill runs and fixes **both**, in the order that makes debugging cheapest: **API first, then UI.** That mirrors CI (`e2e-ui-tests` `needs: e2e-api-tests`) and reflects the dependency — the UI suite exercises the same services the API suite does, plus a browser. A broken backend event flow fails *both* suites, but it's far faster to diagnose at the API layer (resource logs + DB/Stripe polling) than through a browser timeout. So: get API green first, then UI failures are genuinely UI-layer (selectors, navigation, render, SPA wiring), not backend.

## The point of this skill: run autonomously — FIX every failure yourself across both layers

The user is delegating the **entire** run → diagnose → fix → verify loop for BOTH suites. Fix every failure you can in code (service, handler, page object, step def, fixture — wherever the real bug is), re-run, and keep going until both layers are green. Don't report-and-wait; don't treat a baseline "failing" entry as permission to skip. Pause only for a genuine product-behaviour ambiguity you can't resolve from the code ("Test vs prod code — ask first").

## NEVER disable or bypass a step to get past its failure

Same hard rule as both sub-skills. "Fix" means make the failing step work, never make it stop running. **No** `--no-build`/`SuppressBuild` for a slow/hung build; **no** inflating `Polling`/`WaitFor`/Playwright timeouts to outlast a hang; **no** disabling a resource/handler/scenario to go green. If something hangs with no output, reproduce and observe it live (resource states, Docker, process trees) — don't remove it. Bypass only on explicit user request after they've seen the diagnosis.

## Input

- **No arguments** — full two-layer sweep: API suite, fix to green, then UI suite, fix to green.
- **`api` or `ui`** — run only that layer (just defer to that sub-skill; this skill adds nothing over running it directly, but it's a convenient entry point).
- **A specific test / scenario name** — identify its layer (xUnit `FullyQualifiedName` → API; Reqnroll DisplayName → UI), then follow that sub-skill's single-test path.

## Step 0 — Pre-flight (shared)

Both suites need Docker (SQL containers, ASB emulator, stripe-cli) and the Stripe/Google secrets (`Stripe__SecretKey`, `GoogleApiKey`):

```powershell
docker ps 2>&1
```

If the daemon is unreachable, stop and tell the user **"Docker is not running — please start Docker Desktop before running E2E tests."** Do not proceed. If a run dies instantly with a Stripe-auth / missing-config error, confirm the secrets are set before debugging anything else.

Tell the user the plan and rough cost: **"Running the full E2E sweep — API E2E first (~5–7 min), then UI E2E (~25–30 min). I'll fix failures as I find them and report per layer."**

The two E2E apps must **never** run concurrently (the `e2e_parallel_execution` failure root: Vite starvation + dual stripe-cli on one Stripe account). Always run the two layers **sequentially** — which is exactly what doing API-then-UI gives you. Don't kick both off at once.

## Step 1 — API E2E layer (do this FIRST)

Run and fix the API suite to green using the full **`e2e-api-debug`** flow:

```powershell
./e2e.ps1 api run        # both services; exits non-zero on any failure
```

- Watch startup for hangs (Step 0b in `e2e-api-debug` — ASB emulator exit 139, payout-account stall, etc.).
- For each failure, re-run the single test with `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~<test>"` and diagnose by failure shape: synchronous `ShouldBe` body, `Polling.UntilAsync` timeout → **forwarded Aspire resource logs** (`Resources.payment-web` etc.), or Stripe value mismatch. Full mechanics: **`e2e-api-debug`** Steps 2–3.
- Fix the root cause (service / handler / dispatcher / fixture), re-run the test, then re-run `./e2e.ps1 api run` until green.

**Do not start the UI layer until the API layer is green.** A backend flow that's red here will also fail the corresponding UI scenario, and you'd be debugging it the slow way. Getting API green first means any remaining UI failure is real UI-layer work.

If the user scoped to `ui` only, skip this step.

## Step 2 — UI E2E layer (after API is green)

Run and fix the UI suite to green using the full **`e2e-ui-debug`** flow:

```powershell
./e2e.ps1 ui run         # all 30 Reqnroll scenarios, headless
```

- Watch startup (same Aspire AppHost, same startup-hang playbook).
- For each failed scenario, re-run it alone with `--filter "DisplayName~<scenario>"`, and diagnose **HTTP 4xx/5xx first**, then gRPC (callee resource log), then browser console / on-screen errors, then the failure screenshot. Full mechanics: **`e2e-ui-debug`** Steps 2–3.
- Fix the real bug (service, page object, step def, or test support), re-run the scenario, then re-run `./e2e.ps1 ui run`.
- If a scenario **crossed the line** (newly passes or newly fails vs `api/Shared/Tests/Concertable.E2ETests/E2E_BASELINE.md`), prompt the user to update the baseline (move it between `passing`/`failing`, bump the `(N)` counts, update the summary table). The UI baseline is the only baseline — the API suite has none.

If the user scoped to `api` only, skip this step.

## Step 3 — Final verdict

Report per layer, concisely:

```
API E2E:  X/X passed   (fixed: <one-line per fix>)
UI  E2E:  Y/Y passed   (fixed: <one-line per fix>)
```

Both green → done. If you fixed backend code, note that the UI green confirms the fix end to end. If anything is still red because it needs a product decision, name exactly that and what you need.

## Why API-first matters (keep this discipline)

- **Cheaper signal.** An API failure points at a resource log + DB/Stripe state in seconds; the same broken flow in the UI suite is a 60s+ browser timeout with a screenshot of a spinner.
- **No double-debugging.** Fix the event chain once at the API layer and the UI scenario that depended on it usually goes green for free.
- **Honest UI failures.** Once API is green, a remaining UI red is genuinely the browser layer — selectors, `GotoSpaAsync` navigation, render, SPA port/env wiring — not a backend red wearing a browser costume.

## Relationship to the other skills

| Want | Skill |

| Both layers, full sweep + fix | **`e2e-debug`** (this) |
| Service-layer flows only (xUnit + Aspire, no browser) | `e2e-api-debug` |
