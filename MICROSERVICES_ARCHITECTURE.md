# Concertable Microservices Architecture

> **Status:** Direction confirmed, not started. Architectural decisions documented after the 2026-05-18 / 2026-05-19 exploration sessions.
>
> **Goal:** Migrate from the current modular monolith to an event-driven microservices architecture that separates B2B (venue ↔ artist booking + settlement) from Customer (ticket marketplace), with a centralised Payment adapter service.
>
> **Constraint that changed the plan:** This is a learning side project. The Nov 2026 launch in `LAUNCH_PLAN.md` is aspirational, not a hard deadline. Skill development (event-driven architecture, transactional outbox, sagas, OpenTelemetry, Service Bus operations) is an explicit goal alongside any eventual deployment.

---

## 1. Motivation

The current codebase is a .NET modular monolith with strong module boundaries (`IXModule` facades, per-module `DbContext`, in-process domain events). It deploys as one API host (`Concertable.Web`) + Workers + Auth (Duende IS).

Two observations drove the direction change:

1. **B2B and Customer are genuinely different bounded contexts**, not just different audience UIs over the same data:
   - **Customer-side Concert** = "an event I can buy tickets for: when, where, how much, seats remaining."
   - **B2B-side Concert** = "a contracted booking with a workflow state machine (Posted → Applied → Accepted → Verified → Finished → Settled), contract terms, settlement obligations, compliance snapshot."
   - Customer doesn't care about transition validators; B2B doesn't care about ticket buyer identity for most of its work.

2. **Deployment isolation, blast radius, and legal scope all favour separation.** Customer marketplace carries direct consumer liability (CMA, consumer rights, refunds) that B2B does not. If only B2B is deployed (current plan), Customer code shouldn't be in the production binary.

The modular monolith already enforces the *internal* boundary correctly. The microservices step pushes the boundary to the *deployment and data* layers.

## 2. Service inventory

| Logical service | Category | Composition (deployable hosts) | DB | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B2B** | Data | `Concertable.B2B.Api` + `Concertable.B2B.Workers` | B2B SQL | Venue, Artist, Concert (workflow shape), Contract, Booking, Application, Opportunity, Settlement, Organization, Messaging, manager/admin profiles. Manager + venue/artist SPA endpoints. Workers run settlement triggers, lifecycle transitions, payout reconciliation. |
| **Customer** | Data | `Concertable.Customer.Api` + `Concertable.Customer.Workers` | Customer SQL | Tickets (with `AvailableTickets`), Preferences, Reviews, `CustomerProfileEntity`. Workers handle refund batching, projection rebuild from event replay. (Email moves to Notification.) |
| **Search** | Read projection | `Concertable.Search.Api` + `Concertable.Search.Workers` | Search SQL | `ArtistSearchModel`, `VenueSearchModel`, `ConcertSearchModel`. Browse/autocomplete/header/detail reads. Api read-only, sync-callable from B2B and Customer SPAs. Workers consume events from B2B and Customer to populate projections. |
| **Payment** | Adapter | `Concertable.Payment.Api` + `Concertable.Payment.Workers` | Payment SQL | PayoutAccount, StripeCustomer refs, payment intent / transfer / refund ledger. Sole receiver of Stripe webhooks. Workers process webhooks and reconciliation. |
| **Auth** | Adapter | `Concertable.Auth` (Duende IS, single host) | Duende DB | OIDC issuer. Identity authority (`sub`, password hash, email-verification). No role claims. Also issues service tokens for service-to-service auth (§5.5). |
| **Notification** *(deferred — stays in-process until concrete need)* | Adapter | `Concertable.Notification.Workers` (Api optional for template admin) | Notification DB | Email delivery (identity + domain). Owns SMTP/SendGrid credentials, templates. Subscribes to events from Auth/B2B/Customer; sends emails. See §4.7. |

**Non-deployables:**

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `Concertable.AppHost` | Aspire orchestrator | Local dev only. |
| `Concertable.Contracts` | csproj (future NuGet if poly-repo) | The *wire*: event contracts, cross-service DTOs, `ICurrentUser`, static lookups (Genre). |
| `Concertable.Kernel` | csproj (future NuGet if poly-repo) | The *framework*: `BaseEntity`, `Period`, `IUnitOfWork<TContext>`, `DbContextBase`, validation helpers. |
| Azure Service Bus | Managed broker | Async event substrate. |

**Service count:** 6 logical services (5 at first deploy; Notification extracts later per §4.7). 11 deployable hosts at end-state.

## 3. Service categories

A distinction that became load-bearing during the design conversation:

| Category | Sync calls from other services OK? | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Adapter service** — wraps an external concern (Stripe, identity provider, email), owns operational state, exposes operations rather than data fetches | **Yes** — same shape as calling Stripe directly | Payment, Auth, Notification (future), Webhook Receiver (future) |
| **Data service** — owns canonical domain data that consumers think of as their own | **No** — distributed-monolith antipattern. Project via events. | B2B (Venue, Artist, Concert workflow), Customer (Tickets, Reviews, CustomerProfile) |
| **Read projection service** — event-fed denormalised store, read-only from outside | Sync reads OK (it's a projection, not an authority) | Search |

This is the rule the rest of the architecture hangs on. **A read projection service that ever owns a write becomes a data service and loses sync-call privilege.** Search stays read-only; updates flow exclusively through canonical owners' events.

## 4. Data ownership

| Concept | Source of truth | Projected to | Sync mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Venue | B2B DB (`VenueEntity`, full ~25 fields with Organization, PayoutAccount, ComplianceContext) | Search DB (`VenueSearchModel` for browse/details) | `VenueChangedEvent` via bus |
| Artist | B2B DB (`ArtistEntity`, full) | Search DB (`ArtistSearchModel`) | `ArtistChangedEvent` via bus |
| Concert (workflow shape) | B2B DB (`ConcertEntity`, lean — `BookingId`, `ContractType`, `CurrentStage`, `DatePosted`, `TotalTickets` capacity only) | Search DB (`ConcertSearchModel` — buyable/browse view: name, period, price, banner, avatar, genres, images, location, rating) | `ConcertChangedEvent` via bus |
| `TotalTickets` (capacity) | B2B DB (set by venue when posting) | Search DB (display); Customer DB (so Customer can compute remaining) | Carried on `ConcertChangedEvent` |
| `AvailableTickets` (remaining) | Customer DB — decremented atomically with `TicketEntity` insert | Search DB (refresh for "X tickets left" UX) | `TicketPurchasedEvent` / `TicketRefundedEvent` via bus |
| Booking, Contract, Application, Opportunity, Settlement | B2B DB | Not projected | — |
| Ticket | Customer DB (`TicketEntity` — id, sub, concertId, QR, purchaseDate) | B2B DB (`ConcertSalesProjection`: concertId, soldCount, grossRevenue) for dashboards + settlement math | `TicketPurchasedEvent`, `TicketRefundedEvent` via bus |
| Customer→concert Review | Customer DB (`ReviewEntity`) | B2B DB (`ConcertRatingProjection`: artist/venue rating aggregates) — feeds Search rating display via re-publication | `ReviewSubmittedEvent`, `ReviewUpdatedEvent` via bus |
| Venue↔artist Review *(future)* | B2B DB — separate table from customer reviews | Not projected to Customer | — |
| Customer profile, Preferences | Customer DB (`CustomerProfileEntity`) | Not projected to B2B | — |
| Manager/Admin profile | B2B DB (`VenueManagerEntity`, `ArtistManagerEntity`, `AdminEntity` — flat tables post-TPH unwind, each carrying Auth `sub`) | Not projected to Customer | — |
| **Identity** (`sub`, email, password hash, email-verification state) | Auth DB (Duende IS) | Each service stores `sub` on its own profile row | Sync token validation only; no role claim in token |
| `PayoutAccountEntity` (Stripe Connect refs for venues + artists) | Payment DB | Neither — accessed via Payment sync API | Sync call |
| `StripeCustomerEntity` (Stripe Customer refs for venues + artists + customers) | Payment DB | Neither — accessed via Payment sync API | Sync call |
| Payment intent / transfer / refund ledger | Payment DB | Status events published to bus | `PaymentSucceededEvent`, `TransferCompletedEvent`, etc. |

**Notes:**

- `PayoutAccountEntity` and `StripeCustomerEntity` are **not** partitioned between B2B and Customer. Venues and artists are both payers (FlatFee, VenueHire) and payees (DoorSplit, ticket revenue) depending on contract type, so they need both Connect accounts and Stripe Customer refs. Both live in the Payment service.
- **Inverse-direction projections.** Most events flow B2B → Search/Customer for browse. `TicketPurchasedEvent`, `TicketRefundedEvent`, `ReviewSubmittedEvent` flow Customer → B2B for analytics and settlement math. The bus is bidirectional; the canonical-owner rule is what's fixed.
- **Authentication vs authorization.** Auth (Duende) issues tokens with `sub` + audience only — no role claim. Each service derives the persona's role from its own data: B2B inspects the manager-profile subtype/membership for the `sub`; Customer treats any token from its audience as `Customer`. This separates "who are you" (Auth) from "what can you do here" (per-service authorization). `Concertable.Authorization.Contracts` (`ICurrentUser`, claim helpers) stays as a shared library, consumed per-service.
- **Customer/Search projection split.** Customer DB only needs to project what *Customer's own write paths* require (e.g., `TotalTickets` to compute remaining). Browse/detail reads route through Search. This avoids duplicating projections across Customer and Search.

## 4.5 Entity migration map

Where current monolith code lands post-extraction. Sequence matters — most of this should happen *in-process* before any service split, so the cross-process move is a packaging change rather than a refactor.

### Concert module decomposition

`ConcertEntity` is currently a god-entity: B2B workflow fields *and* customer-display fields on one row.

| Current field on `ConcertEntity` | Post-split owner |
|---|---|
| `BookingId`, `ContractType`, `CurrentStage`, `DatePosted` | B2B (workflow shape, canonical) |
| `TotalTickets` (capacity) | B2B (set by venue when posting) → Search + Customer projections |
| `AvailableTickets` (remaining) | **Customer** — moves off B2B's `ConcertEntity` entirely (see "Customer's ConcertEntity" below) |
| `Name`, `About`, `Price`, `BannerUrl`, `Avatar`, `Period`, `Location` | B2B (canonical for editing) → Search (browse projection) |
| `ConcertGenres`, `Images` | B2B (canonical) → Search (browse projection) |
| `Tickets` collection | **Customer** — `TicketEntity` moves out of `Concert.Domain` |

### Customer's `ConcertEntity` (new — Customer's bounded-context view)

Customer gets its own `ConcertEntity` (same name as B2B's, different shape) — **not** a projection table named `ConcertTicketAvailability` or similar. Within Customer's bounded context, this row *is* a Concert: it has behavior (`DecrementAvailability(int)`), invariants (`AvailableTickets >= 0`, `AvailableTickets <= TotalTickets`), and a lifecycle.

```csharp
// Customer.Domain.Entities.ConcertEntity
public class ConcertEntity : BaseEntity<int> {
    public int TotalTickets { get; private set; }       // sourced from ConcertChangedEvent
    public int AvailableTickets { get; private set; }    // Customer owns; decremented on purchase

    public void DecrementAvailability(int qty) { ... }
    public void RestoreAvailability(int qty) { ... }     // on refund
}
```

**Naming rationale:** B2B's `ConcertEntity` and Customer's `ConcertEntity` share the same `Id` (so cross-context events correlate) but have entirely different shapes because each bounded context cares about different things — textbook §1 ("Customer's Concert ≠ B2B's Concert"). Naming Customer's row as a "projection" or "availability" would falsely imply it's data-only; in fact it owns business rules around ticket allocation. Different ubiquitous language per context is the DDD-correct outcome.

**Namespace disambiguation at the code level:** `B2B.Concert.Domain.Entities.ConcertEntity` vs `Customer.Domain.Entities.ConcertEntity`. They never appear in the same file. Cross-service events use `Concertable.Contracts.ConcertId` for correlation, not either entity type.

### Whole-entity moves out of `Concert.Domain`

| Today in | Moves to |
|---|---|
| `Concert.Domain/Entities/TicketEntity.cs` | `Customer.Domain/Entities/TicketEntity.cs` |
| `Concert.Domain/Entities/ReviewEntity.cs` | `Customer.Domain/Entities/ReviewEntity.cs` |
| `Concert.Api/Controllers/TicketController.cs` | `Customer.Api/Controllers/TicketController.cs` |
| `Concert.Api/Controllers/ConcertReviewsController.cs` | `Customer.Api/Controllers/ConcertReviewsController.cs` |
| `Concert.Application/Interfaces/Reviews/*`, ticket services | `Customer.Application/...` |
| `Concert.Infrastructure` packages: QRCoder, QuestPDF (ticket QR/PDF generation) | `Customer.Infrastructure` |

### Read-projection moves

| Today in | Moves to |
|---|---|
| `Concert.Domain/ReadModels/ArtistReadModel.cs` | `Search.Domain` (consolidated with existing `ArtistSearchModel`) |
| `Concert.Domain/ReadModels/VenueReadModel.cs` | `Search.Domain` (consolidated with existing `VenueSearchModel`) |
| `Concert.Domain/ReadModels/ConcertRatingProjection.cs` | Split: B2B keeps for dashboards; Search re-publishes rating for browse |
| `ConcertController.GetDetailsById`, `GetUpcomingByVenueId`, `GetUpcomingByArtistId`, `GetHistory*`, `GetUnposted*`, `Search` header endpoints | **`Search.Api`** — Search owns *all* read-projection details endpoints |
| `ConcertController.Update`, `Post` (write paths, `[VenueManager]`-gated) | Stay in B2B (`Concert.Api`) |

### User module dismantling

`Modules/User/` (current TPH: `VenueManagerEntity` / `ArtistManagerEntity` / `CustomerEntity` / `AdminEntity` extending `UserEntity`) gets fully unwound:

| Today | Post-split |
|---|---|
| `UserEntity` base (email, password hash, email-verification) | **Auth** — Duende IS owns the identity record |
| `VenueManagerEntity`, `ArtistManagerEntity`, `AdminEntity` | **B2B** — flat tables (no TPH), each carrying Auth `sub` + B2B-specific fields (`VenueId`, `ArtistId`, etc.) |
| `CustomerEntity` | **Customer** — becomes `CustomerProfileEntity` (no TPH), carries Auth `sub` + customer-side fields (location, avatar, preferences) |
| `Role` enum on `UserEntity` | **Deleted** — role inferred from token audience + service-side profile-table membership |
| `Modules/Authorization/` (`ICurrentUser`, claim extensions) | Stays as cross-cutting library in `Concertable.Contracts` (or its own NuGet), consumed per-service |

### Search module extraction

`Modules/Search/` becomes its own service largely as-is. Two cleanups required first:

- `Search.Infrastructure` currently references `Artist.Infrastructure` and `Venue.Infrastructure` (per `project_search_rating_projection_ownership`). Post-extraction, Search consumes events only — no upstream module-infrastructure refs.
- Existing `ArtistReadModel` / `VenueReadModel` in `Concert.Domain` consolidate into Search's `*SearchModel`s; the dual-model split is a monolith-era convenience, not a microservices boundary.

### Modules that stay where they are (named for completeness)

| Module | Lands in |
|---|---|
| `Modules/Artist`, `Modules/Venue` | B2B (canonical owners) |
| `Modules/Contract` | B2B |
| `Modules/Messaging` (venue↔artist messaging) | B2B |
| `Modules/Notification` | Stays in-process initially; future adapter service (deferred per §11 Q2) |
| `Modules/Payment` | Already shaped as adapter service; extracts straight across |

## 4.6 Reference data ownership

Reference data is split by characteristic:

- **Enum-like, static, never admin-CRUD'd** — lives as constants in `Concertable.Contracts`. No DB row in any service. **Genre is this case**: ~20–50 values, set when artist/concert is created, never edited at runtime. The current `SharedDbContext.Genres` table is **deleted**; Genre becomes a `record GenreId(int Value)` or `enum Genre` in `Concertable.Contracts`. Search projects genre names denormalized onto `*SearchModel`s — consumers never join on GenreId.
- **Admin-editable reference data** (none in Concertable today) — owned by exactly one canonical service. Name denormalized onto outbound events. Treat like Venue.
- **Per-service status enums** (`OpportunityStage`, `ContractType`) — stay local to the owning service. No cross-service sharing needed.

Rule: ask "does this reference data need an admin UI?" If no, it's a contract, not a service. Resist the temptation to make a `Concertable.ReferenceData` service.

## 4.7 Cross-cutting infrastructure: Notification

Email is the first cross-cutting concern that earns its own adapter service. `Concertable.Notification` is the 6th logical service.

**Two flavors of email Notification handles:**

- **Identity email** (verification, password reset) — Auth publishes `EmailVerificationRequestedEvent`, `PasswordResetRequestedEvent`; Notification subscribes.
- **Domain email** (application accepted, ticket purchased, booking settled) — B2B/Customer publish their normal domain events; Notification subscribes to the same events that already drive projections.

**Why a separate service** (same logic as Payment):

- SMTP/SendGrid credentials, email templates, deliverability tracking all live in one place
- Vendor swap is an internal-only change
- Notification crashes don't take down B2B's settlement workflow
- Email volume can spike independently of write workload

**Extraction timing:** stays as `Modules/Notification` (in-process) until *after* Customer extracts. Pre-extraction, Auth talks to SMTP/SendGrid SDK directly — pragmatic, small refactor surface when Notification extracts later. Don't pre-extract Notification before there's measurable pressure.

**Future cross-cutting adapters** (file storage, image CDN, geocoding) follow the same shape — but only *if* they grow beyond library wrappers. Until then, they're NuGet packages consumed in-process by each service.

## 4.8 Resolution of `api/Shared/*`

The current six `Concertable.Shared.*` csprojs collapse into **two csprojs**: one for the wire, one for the framework.

| Today | Post-split | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `Concertable.Shared.Contracts` | → `Concertable.Contracts` | Event contracts + cross-service DTOs + Genre lookup + `ICurrentUser` |
| `Concertable.Shared.Domain` | → `Concertable.Kernel` | `BaseEntity`, `ValueObject`, `Period`, `IEventRaiser`, `IDateRange` |
| `Concertable.Shared.Application` | → `Concertable.Kernel` | `IUnitOfWork<TContext>`, `IUnitOfWorkBehavior`, base specification types |
| `Concertable.Shared.Infrastructure` | → `Concertable.Kernel` | `DbContextBase`, `UnitOfWork<TContext>` impl, `BaseRepository`/`Repository`/`GuidRepository` bases |
| `Concertable.Shared.Validation` | → `Concertable.Kernel` | FluentValidation extensions |
| `Concertable.Shared.UnitTests` | → tests for `Concertable.Kernel` | — |
| `SharedDbContext` (Genres only) | **Deleted** | Genre moves to `Concertable.Contracts` as enum |
| `Modules/Authorization/` (`ICurrentUser`, claim helpers) | → `Concertable.Contracts` | Q5 resolved |

**Two-package rule:**

- **`Concertable.Contracts`** = the *wire*. What flows between services. Breaking changes = protocol changes.
- **`Concertable.Kernel`** = the *framework*. Internal building blocks. Breaking changes = compile failures, not protocol breaks.

Both are csprojs in the mono-repo (`api/Shared/Concertable.Contracts/` and `api/Shared/Concertable.Kernel/`). Each service references them via `<ProjectReference>`. The same csproj appears in multiple `.sln` files — normal in .NET mono-repos.

If the repo ever splits poly-repo, both become NuGet packages published to a private feed; references become `<PackageReference>` with versioning. Mechanical conversion, zero architectural change.

## 5. Communication patterns

| Channel | Used for | Used between |
|---|---|---|
| **Async events on Azure Service Bus (MassTransit)** | Domain-event-driven projection updates, cross-service workflow coordination | B2B ↔ Customer (only mode); B2B/Customer → Search (projection feed); B2B/Customer ↔ Payment for webhooks |
| **Sync HTTP to adapter services** | Payment operations (create intent, transfer, refund); Auth token validation | B2B/Customer/Search → Payment; all → Auth |
| **Sync HTTP to read projection service** | Browse, autocomplete, header, detail-page reads | B2B SPAs → Search.Api; Customer SPA → Search.Api |
| **Sync HTTP from clients to services** | SPA / mobile → service | Customer SPA → Customer.Api; B2B SPAs → B2B.Api; both → Search.Api |
| **External SDK / HTTP** | Third-party integration | Payment → Stripe, services → geocoding, services → image storage |

**Disallowed:**

- **Sync HTTP between B2B.Api and Customer.Api** — would create distributed-monolith coupling. Async events only.
- **Sync HTTP from Search.Api outbound to B2B or Customer** — Search is read-only and event-fed. If Search ever needed to "fill in a missing field" by sync-calling a data service, the projection is wrong and the fix is to expand the event, not introduce coupling.
- **gRPC between services** — same antipattern risk as sync HTTP, with worse-fitting tooling.
- **Cross-service joins, shared schemas, shared DBs** — each service has its own database.
- **Project references between B2B modules and Customer modules** — only `Concertable.Contracts` (and the authorization-helpers library) may be referenced by both. Enforce via CI architecture tests.

## 5.5 Service-to-service authentication

**Decision: OAuth2 `client_credentials` via Duende.** Each service is registered as a Client in Auth with its own `client_id` + secret. When B2B needs to call Payment, B2B requests a service token from Auth (via the existing OIDC issuer), then presents it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Payment validates audience + scope using the same JWT middleware it uses for user tokens.

This works because Auth is already there for user tokens — Duende IS supports `client_credentials` grant natively. Adding service-to-service auth is "register one more Client per service" rather than a new authentication subsystem.

**Alternatives considered:**

| Option | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| client_credentials via Duende | **Chosen** | Duende already there; same JWT plumbing as user auth; standard pattern; trivial to add |
| mTLS | Rejected for now | Stronger identity but cert lifecycle is operationally heavy. Revisit if compliance ever demands it. |
| API keys | Rejected | No proper claims model; rotation/revocation brittle; no audience scoping |
| VNet only (no wire auth) | Rejected as primary | "Soft chewy center" — one network breach compromises everything. Used as defense-in-depth on top, not instead of |

**Production posture:** client_credentials on the wire **+** private network (VNet/VPC) as defense-in-depth. Internal services aren't publicly addressable except via API gateway, *and* every internal call carries a service token.

**Local dev:** Aspire AppHost wires the same client_credentials flow against the local Duende instance. No "skip auth in dev" mode — keeps the path tested.

**Note on roles:** Service tokens carry **scope** (e.g., `payment:write`, `auth:read`), not roles. User tokens carry **`sub` + audience**, also no role claim. Roles are derived per-service from token audience + service-side profile-table membership (§4 Identity row). Auth never emits a role claim into either type of token.

## 6. Event-driven CQRS pattern

The data-service side of the architecture is cross-service CQRS: write model on B2B, read model on Customer, bus keeps them aligned.

**Flow on a Venue update:**

```
1. Venue manager edits venue in B2B SPA
2. POST /venues/{id} hits B2B.Api → VenueController → VenueService.UpdateAsync
3. VenueEntity.Update(...) raises VenueChangedDomainEvent (in-process)
4. SaveChanges interceptor reads pending domain events,
   writes VenueChangedEvent row into B2B's Outbox table,
   commits both in one DB transaction
5. MassTransit EntityFrameworkOutbox processor drains Outbox,
   publishes to Service Bus topic "venue-changed"
6. Customer.Workers consumes the message:
   - Inbox table check (idempotency)
   - VenueProjectionHandler updates Customer DB's slim Venue projection
   - Records message ID in Inbox in same transaction
7. Next Customer SPA detail page load reads the updated projection
```

End-to-end latency: typically a few hundred milliseconds. Eventual consistency window must be reflected in UX where it matters.

> **Why the outbox earns its keep — the dual-write problem.**
>
> Without it: `await SaveChangesAsync()` commits the DB row, then `await bus.PublishAsync(evt)` fails (process crash, broker outage). The DB has the change; nobody downstream ever hears about it. Or the inverse — publish succeeds, save fails — and you've broadcast a ghost event. Either way, B2B and Customer drift silently.
>
> The outbox makes step 4 *one* DB transaction: domain row + outbox row commit together. The sweeper (step 5) drains the outbox after the fact, retrying until it gets through. Inbox idempotency on the consumer (step 6) handles the at-least-once redelivery this guarantees. Combined: exactly-once *effects* from at-least-once *delivery* — the only honest semantic distributed systems will give you.

### Inverse-direction flow: ticket purchase

The same pattern runs Customer → B2B for analytics and settlement math:

```
1. Customer SPA: POST /tickets/purchase → Customer.Api → TicketService.PurchaseAsync
2. Sync call to Payment.Api → CreatePaymentIntent (PCI scope stays in Payment)
3. Customer DB transaction: insert TicketEntity + decrement AvailableTickets on Concert projection
   + insert TicketPurchasedEvent row in Customer's outbox — one transaction
4. MassTransit drains, publishes to Service Bus topic "ticket-purchased"
5. B2B.Workers consumes: inbox check → update ConcertSalesProjection (soldCount, grossRevenue)
6. Search.Workers consumes the same event: refresh Search's ConcertSearchModel "tickets left" display
7. Venue/Artist dashboards (B2B) read ConcertSalesProjection; settlement math reads it too
```

Same plumbing, opposite direction. There is no "B2B-first" rule in the architecture — only "canonical owner publishes; consumers project."

## 7. Payment service architecture

Payment is the most distinctive piece of the design — sole reason it's worth pulling out as a separate adapter service:

- **PCI scope containment** — only Payment holds Stripe API keys. Everything else is out of PCI scope. Big audit win.
- **Single Stripe integration** — one place handles webhooks, idempotency, retry semantics, 3DS, refund routing, dispute handling.
- **Operational ledger** — single DB owns "what payments happened, in what state, confirmed when."
- **Processor abstraction** — if a second processor (Adyen, GoCardless) is ever added, the abstraction lives in one place.
- **Sole webhook receiver** — Stripe sends all webhooks to Payment, which validates signature and publishes domain-meaningful events to the bus.

**Payment API (sync, called by B2B and Customer):**

- `ProvisionConnectAccountAsync` — seller onboarding (B2B)
- `ProvisionStripeCustomerAsync` — anyone who needs to pay
- `CreatePaymentIntentAsync` — B2B settlement OR Customer ticket purchase
- `TransferToConnectAsync` — B2B settlement payouts
- `RefundAsync` — B2B cancellation OR Customer refund
- `GetPaymentStatusAsync` — consumer checks state

**Payment publishes to bus:**

- `PaymentSucceededEvent` — Customer subscribes for ticket confirmation; B2B subscribes for booking settlement
- `PaymentFailedEvent`
- `ConnectAccountUpdatedEvent` — B2B subscribes for DAC7/compliance status changes
- `TransferCompletedEvent` — B2B subscribes for payout ledger

## 8. Repository structure

Single Git repo, single `.sln` (or split into multiple `.sln` files for build performance later). Designed so a poly-repo split is a folder move and packaging change, not a rewrite.

└── ...
```

**Discipline that keeps poly-repo optionality:**

1. No sync HTTP between B2B and Customer. Async events only.
2. Shared code lives only in `Concertable.Contracts` (or future shared adapter NuGets).
3. Per-service database, per-service migrations.
4. CI architecture test (NetArchTest or similar) fails the build on boundary violations.

If those hold, mono-repo → poly-repo is a folder move + replacing project references with NuGet feeds.

## 8.5 Modular monolith inside each microservice

The microservices split **does not retire the modular monolith pattern** — it shrinks the pattern's scope to the inside of each service. The current discipline (`IXModule` facades, per-module `XDbContext` with its own schema, in-process domain events between modules via `IEventRaiser`, module-owned `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>`, NetArchTest boundary enforcement, `MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES.md`) **carries forward verbatim into each microservice's internal structure**.

**Inside `Concertable.B2B`:**

```
B2B/
├── Concertable.B2B.Api/                (HTTP host — composition root)
├── Concertable.B2B.Workers/            (background jobs host)
└── Modules/
    ├── Venue/        Api + Application + Domain + Infrastructure + Contracts
    ├── Artist/       same shape
    ├── Concert/      same shape (now lean post-decomposition)
    ├── Contract/
    ├── Booking/
    ├── Application/
    ├── Opportunity/
    ├── Organization/
    └── Messaging/
```

Same shape inside `Concertable.Customer` (modules: Ticket, Review, Preference, CustomerProfile), `Concertable.Search` (VenueSearchModel, ArtistSearchModel, ConcertSearchModel as projection modules), `Concertable.Payment` (Stripe integration, ledger), `Concertable.Notification` (templates, transport).

**What stays:**

- `IXModule` facade per module (cross-module access goes through it; no direct entity reach-in)
- Per-module `XDbContext` with its own schema, owning only its tables (all DbContexts now point at the same B2B DB, but tables stay schema-isolated)
- In-process domain events between modules (`IEventRaiser` + `XChangedDomainEvent`) — cheap, synchronous, no bus involvement for intra-service flows
- Module-owned `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` in `Module.Infrastructure/Data/Configurations/`
- Per-module `IDevSeeder` / `ITestSeeder` at `Order=N`
- `InternalsVisibleTo` chains keeping `Module.Application` interfaces `internal`
- Module per-context migrations (one history table per service's DB; modules within the service still have their own migrations)
- NetArchTest rules enforcing cross-module discipline

**What changes:**

- Cross-service module access (e.g., Customer's Ticket module → B2B's Concert module) is **no longer in-process** — it goes via the bus (events for projection updates) or sync HTTP to adapter services. Within a single service, cross-module access remains in-process.
- The "Concertable.Workers" composition host splits into per-service Workers hosts (`B2B.Workers`, `Customer.Workers`, etc.). Each Workers host loads only its own service's modules.
- `Concertable.AppHost` orchestrates N service hosts in dev, where today it orchestrates one Web + one Workers.

**Why this earns its keep:**

- If a sub-module within a service later needs its own deployable (e.g., `Contract` grows to warrant a `Concertable.Contract.Api`), extraction is a packaging change because the internal boundary already exists.
- In-process domain events between modules avoid the latency and operational complexity of the bus for flows that don't actually cross a service boundary.
- The same patterns devs (or future-you) already know, scoped smaller.
- `MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES.md` doesn't get deleted — it gets cited *per service*.

**What this is not:** an excuse to keep B2B and Customer modules together. The microservices split between bounded contexts (§1) is not negotiable. Inside a bounded context, the modular monolith pattern still applies.

## 9. Learning sequence

The architecture is the *what*; this is the *how to build it as a learning project*. Each step teaches a specific concept. Steps 0–2 happen *in the monolith* before any process split — the lesson "shrink the boundary in-process first" is itself the point.

0. **Decompose `ConcertEntity` in-place.** While still in one process, split B2B workflow fields from customer-display fields per §4.5. Move `TicketEntity` and `ReviewEntity` out of `Concert.Domain` into `Customer.Domain`. Move ticket QR/PDF infrastructure (QRCoder, QuestPDF) with them. Migrate `ConcertController` read endpoints into Search's existing controllers. Result: the monolith already has the *internal* boundary the future split will materialize.
1. **Dismantle the `Modules/User/` TPH.** Replace with flat per-persona profile entities owned by their respective modules; move identity authority into Auth (Duende). Strip role claims from issued tokens; derive role per-service from token audience + profile-table membership.
2. **Clean Search's upstream refs.** Remove `Search.Infrastructure` references to `Artist.Infrastructure` / `Venue.Infrastructure`. Search consumes domain events only.
3. **Extract Customer to its own service.** New solution folder, own `Program.cs`, own DbContext on its own SQL Server (or separate DB on same instance — same lesson). References only `Concertable.Contracts`.
4. **MassTransit on in-memory transport** between B2B and Customer. Skip cloud broker latency while learning publish/subscribe semantics.
5. **Transactional outbox** via MassTransit's `EntityFrameworkOutbox`. Lesson: "publish reliably exactly when the DB transaction commits." (§6 callout.)
6. **Idempotent consumers** with inbox state. Lesson: "events arrive at-least-once, sometimes out of order — handlers must be safe."
7. **Extract Search to its own service.** Same playbook as Customer, but read-only and consumes events from both B2B and Customer.
8. **Switch transport to RabbitMQ** in a Docker container. Operational layer without cloud cost.
9. **Switch transport to Azure Service Bus.** Queues vs topics, subscriptions, dead-letter handling, sessions for ordering.
10. **Extract Payment to its own service** with its own DB and webhook endpoint.
11. **Build one saga** for the concert lifecycle (Posted → Settled). MassTransit's state machine. Lesson: long-running orchestration with persistent state.
12. **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** across services. Watch a flow end-to-end.
13. **Hard event-schema migration.** Change an event's shape with consumers running both old and new versions.

Roughly a year of evenings-and-weekends if taken seriously. Valuable on a CV at senior-backend level.

## 10. Non-goals and rejected patterns

- **No gRPC between services.** Synchronous coupling regardless of wire format.
- **No shared "domain logic" service that B2B and Customer both call sync for venue/concert/artist data.** That is the distributed-monolith antipattern. Project via events instead.
- **No shared database.** Each service has its own. Citadel (shared DB, multiple hosts) was considered and rejected because it doesn't serve the learning goals.
- **No premature webhook fan-out service.** Single Webhook Receiver service is an option *later* if Stripe event routing gets complex. Start with each service exposing its own webhook endpoint, or Payment receiving all webhooks.
- **No native mobile apps in launch scope** (already in LAUNCH_PLAN.md).

## 11. Risks and open questions

| # | Risk / question | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Eventual-consistency UX is harder than it looks. Customer briefly sees stale Concert data after B2B updates. | Mitigation: design UX with refresh affordances; surface "live" indicators only where consistency matters. |
| R2 | Event schema versioning over time. Once published, events can't change shape easily. | Mitigation: deliberate event design; version events explicitly; learn this via final step of the sequence. |
| R3 | Solo dev maintenance overhead of N services. | Mitigation: mono-repo + Aspire AppHost keeps local-dev friction low. Production deploy complexity is real if it ever ships. |
| R4 | Stripe webhook routing — does Payment handle all of them, or per-service endpoints? | Open. Default: Payment handles all (PCI scope reasons), fans out via bus. Revisit if it gets noisy. |
| R5 | Ticket purchase is the highest-write event. Per-event projection scales fine for normal load but a flash sale will pin the inbox handler on the B2B + Search consumers. | Mitigation: defer until measured. Options when it bites: batched/windowed projection, dedicated consumer scaling, summary events instead of per-ticket. |
| R6 | `Modules/User/` TPH unwind (§4.5) touches every B2B controller that reads `ICurrentUser` for role/persona checks. Sequence carefully so the monolith builds at each step. | Mitigation: do the role-claim removal in Auth first, derive role from token audience + DB lookup per controller, *then* delete the TPH. |
| R7 | `ConcertEntity` decomposition (Step 0) is the biggest in-monolith refactor on the path. Touches Concert + Customer + Search projections + every read path. | Mitigation: explicit migration step (§4.5) sequences the field moves; ship in small PRs; integration tests cover both old and new shapes during transition. |
| ~~Q1~~ R8 *(was Q1)* | **Resolved 2026-05-19** — Search is its own service, sync-callable from both B2B and Customer SPAs. Single projection serves both audiences; no duplicate browse-projection tables in B2B and Customer. Updates stay with canonical owners. | — |
| ~~Q2~~ R9 *(was Q2)* | **Resolved 2026-05-19** — Notification is the 6th logical adapter service (see §4.7). Stays in-process until after Customer extracts; then extracts as `Concertable.Notification`. Auth talks to SMTP/SendGrid directly pre-extraction. | — |
| Q3 | Do we eventually need a dedicated `Concertable.Webhooks.Stripe` service separate from Payment? | Only if Stripe event handling outgrows Payment. Defer. |
| Q4 | Future B2B venue↔artist reviews — same `ReviewEntity` shape as customer reviews, or different? | Open. Default: separate table in B2B (different bounded context, even if conceptually similar). Same conceptual name `Review` is fine across services. |
| ~~Q5~~ R10 *(was Q5)* | **Resolved 2026-05-19** — `ICurrentUser` and claim helpers live in `Concertable.Contracts` (the wire package). See §4.8. No central authorization service; each service makes its own authz decisions against tokens it validates. | — |
| Q6 | Service-to-service auth in `client_credentials` model: how are scopes structured? Per-callee service (`payment:write`, `auth:read`) or finer (`payment:intent:create`)? | Open. Default: start coarse (one scope per callee service), refine only if a service legitimately needs to distinguish caller intents. |
| Q7 | Event schema versioning concrete mechanism. `V1`/`V2` type names? CloudEvents headers? Upcaster pattern? | Open. Decide at Step 13 of §9 with concrete migration in hand. |
| Q8 | DB-per-service cutover when extracting Customer (Step 3 §9). One logical DB → N physical DBs operationally — backup/restore, logical export, tolerated downtime? | Open. Likely "fresh DB + replay events from B2B outbox to populate Customer's projections" since the boundary is fresh; but spike it before committing. |

## 12. Decision log

- **2026-05-18** — Direction shift from modular-monolith Citadel to event-driven microservices. Rationale: learning project framing; bounded contexts genuinely differ; deployment isolation matters.
- **2026-05-18** — Citadel pattern (two hosts sharing one DB) considered and rejected for this project. Reason: it served deadline-driven launch goals, not learning goals.
- **2026-05-18** — Mono-repo retained; poly-repo optionality preserved by event-only inter-service communication.
- **2026-05-19** — Payment is its own adapter service, not internal modules per audience. Reason: PCI scope containment + venues/artists are both payers and payees so Connect/Customer refs can't be partitioned by audience.
- **2026-05-19** — Adapter vs data service distinction codified. Adapter services (Payment, Auth) are legitimately shared with sync calls; data services (Venue/Artist/Concert) are not.
- **2026-05-19** — gRPC explicitly out of scope for inter-service communication.
- **2026-05-19** — Customer owns `TicketEntity`, `ReviewEntity`, and `AvailableTickets`. Reason: every field on `TicketEntity` (`sub`, QR, purchase date) is customer-side; the marketplace is what *sells* the ticket. Splitting `AvailableTickets` from Tickets causes a race-condition window; ownership stays together.
- **2026-05-19** — B2B keeps `TotalTickets` as capacity (set when venue posts concert). Customer projects it and tracks its own `AvailableTickets` locally. Settlement math reads `ConcertSalesProjection` populated by inverse-direction `TicketPurchasedEvent`.
- **2026-05-19** — Inverse-direction projections legitimized. Customer → B2B for tickets/reviews/analytics; B2B → Customer for venue/artist/concert metadata. The canonical-owner rule is what's fixed; direction follows ownership.
- **2026-05-19** — Search is its own deployable read projection service (`Concertable.Search.Api`), sync-callable from both B2B and Customer SPAs. Owns `*SearchModel`s + browse/detail/autocomplete endpoints. Read-only — writes flow through canonical owners and reach Search via events. Reason: Search is already shaped as a projection in the monolith; serving both audiences from one projection avoids duplicating browse tables across Customer and B2B.
- **2026-05-19** — `Modules/User/` TPH dismantled. Identity authority lives in Auth (Duende: `sub`, email, password hash, email-verification). Each service owns a flat per-persona profile entity carrying the `sub` (B2B: `VenueManagerEntity`/`ArtistManagerEntity`/`AdminEntity`; Customer: `CustomerProfileEntity`). Reason: customer data should not live in B2B; a TPH spanning two bounded contexts is the monolith leaking across the split.
- **2026-05-19** — Authentication and authorization explicitly separated. Auth issues tokens with `sub` + audience only, no role claim. Each service derives role from token audience (Customer audience ⇒ Customer role) + service-side profile-table membership (B2B looks up `sub` in manager/admin tables to determine persona). Reason: identity ("who are you") and authorization ("what can you do *here*") are different concerns; baking role claims into the identity token couples them and leaks per-service authorization rules into Auth.
- **2026-05-19** — Future B2B venue↔artist reviews (post-gig counterparty feedback) will live as a separate B2B-owned table. Same conceptual name `Review` is fine because the two reviews live in different bounded contexts.
- **2026-05-19** — Reference data ownership rule (§4.6): enum-like static data (Genre) lives in `Concertable.Contracts` as constants/enums, not as a DB table. The current `SharedDbContext.Genres` table gets deleted in Phase 1 (per `MICROSERVICE_STEPS.md`). Search projects genre names denormalized onto `*SearchModel`s. Reason: shipping reference data as a contract avoids both shared-DB coupling and a needless "reference data service."
- **2026-05-19** — Notification confirmed as 6th logical adapter service (§4.7). Two flavors of email — identity (verification, password reset) from Auth and domain (booking accepted, ticket purchased) from B2B/Customer — both consumed by Notification via bus events. Extraction deferred until after Customer extracts; Auth uses SMTP/SendGrid SDK directly in the interim.
- **2026-05-19** — `api/Shared/*` six csprojs collapse to two (§4.8): `Concertable.Contracts` (the wire — event types, cross-service DTOs, `ICurrentUser`, Genre lookup) and `Concertable.Kernel` (the framework — `BaseEntity`, `Period`, `IUnitOfWork<TContext>`, `DbContextBase`, validation helpers). Reason: two packages with distinct breaking-change semantics is the minimum useful split; six is monolith-era ergonomics.
- **2026-05-19** — `SharedDbContext` deleted as part of §4.6 + §4.8 collapse. Genre moves to `Concertable.Contracts` as enum; `SharedDbContext` had no other tables worth keeping.
- **2026-05-19** — Service-to-service auth (§5.5): OAuth2 `client_credentials` via Duende. Each service is a Client; service tokens carry scope (not roles); same JWT validation middleware as user tokens. Production posture = client_credentials on the wire + private network as defense-in-depth. Rejected: mTLS (operationally heavy for solo dev), API keys (no proper claims), VNet-only (soft-chewy-center antipattern).
- **2026-05-19** — `RoleEnforcingInteractionResponseGenerator` + `IClientRoleResolver` + `Role` enum (`Concertable.User.Contracts.Role`) are pre-split artifacts and get **deleted** when Step 1 of `MICROSERVICE_STEPS.md` (TPH unwind + Auth identity-only) lands. Post-split Auth has no `role` concept — neither at login enforcement nor in issued tokens. Per-service authorization rejects tokens whose `sub` isn't in the service's profile tables; that replaces the "user must have role X for client Y" check. Reason: keeping role enforcement in Auth re-couples identity to per-service authorization rules.
- **2026-05-19** — **Modular monolith pattern stays inside each microservice** (§8.5). `IXModule` facades, per-module `XDbContext` with own schema, in-process domain events between modules, module-owned EF configs, NetArchTest module-boundary rules, `MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES.md` — all carry forward verbatim *inside* each service. The microservices split shrinks the pattern's scope to per-service; it does not retire the pattern. Cross-module access stays in-process for intra-service flows; only cross-*service* flows hit the bus. Reason: the discipline isn't throwaway, future sub-extraction stays cheap, and intra-service in-process events avoid bus overhead for flows that don't cross bounded contexts.
- **2026-05-19** — Customer's slim concert row is named `ConcertEntity` (in `Customer.Domain.Entities`), not `ConcertTicketAvailability` or any "projection-ish" name. Same name as B2B's `ConcertEntity` but a different shape and different ubiquitous language — DDD-correct outcome of "Customer's Concert ≠ B2B's Concert" (§1). Customer's `ConcertEntity` owns behavior (`DecrementAvailability` / `RestoreAvailability`) and invariants (`AvailableTickets >= 0`, `<= TotalTickets`), not just data, so calling it a "projection" would mislead. Shared `Id` correlates events across contexts; namespace disambiguation handles the code-level naming overlap. See §4.5 "Customer's `ConcertEntity`".
