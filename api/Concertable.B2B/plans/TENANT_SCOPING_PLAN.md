# Tenant Scoping Plan

Purely tenant scoping: introduce the tenant as the entity the operator side revolves around, wire the
row-level isolation, re-key settlement to it — and otherwise leave the app behaving as it does today. No
new users, no role/membership model. Just give the data a tenant boundary it currently lacks.

**Status:** Canonical. Replaces the earlier Finbuckle `TENANT_PLAN.md` and
`api/Concertable.B2B/TENANCY_DESIGN.md` — both deleted in the change that lands this. Working doc, not
an archive.

**Scope:** B2B only. Payment is touched at its edge (re-keying the payout owner) but stays an agnostic
adapter — see §6. Customer/Search are unaffected.

**No new users — that's the boundary.** The app keeps behaving roughly as today; this plan just makes
the data **tenant-scoped** underneath it. Everything that should be tenant-scoped *is*, and resolution
**works** — this is not stubbed. What's deliberately deferred is the **multi-user model**: no new user
types, no membership table, no roles (Owner/Manager/read-only), no auth sweep, no multi-tenant switching,
and not the `MessageEntity` group-inbox decision. Those wait for a later session.

The bit that keeps it functional now: **one tenant per setup** — when a user registers/sets up, a tenant
is created and they are its sole, implicit owner (*not* a new user), and `ITenantContext` resolves that
single tenant from `ICurrentUser.Id`. So there's exactly one user per tenant for now, and the filters
genuinely isolate.

## 0. Decision (locked)

**Row-level isolation = plain EF Core 10 *named query filters*. We do NOT use Finbuckle.MultiTenant.**

Why, against this codebase specifically:

- **The product is a SaaS-enabled marketplace, not siloed B2B SaaS.** We sell software to venue
  operators (the SaaS part), and the value is operators transacting *with* artists — bookings and
  settlements that belong to **two tenants at once**. That is *marketplace tenancy*: partial,
  relationship-scoped isolation. Finbuckle's model is one-tenant-owns-each-row (`[MultiTenant]` → a
  single `TenantId` equality filter); it fits the *operator-private* half and **cannot express** the
  two-party half (`operator == me || artist == me`). We'd hand-write those predicates under Finbuckle
  anyway — so it would cover only the easy half while we maintain a second mechanism for the money rows
  that matter most.
- **EF Core 10 named filters remove the only historical reason to reach for a library.** Multiple named
  filters per entity, each toggled independently (`IgnoreQueryFilters(["Tenant"])`), so a future
  `"SoftDelete"` filter (GDPR erasure — `Modules/Contract/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` item 8) coexists with
  `"Tenant"` and is disabled separately. One mechanism covers single-owner *and* two-party rows.
- **It fits the seams we already have.** `ICurrentUser` already resolves identity from JWT claims;
  `AuditInterceptor` already stamps `IAuditable` at `SaveChanges`; per-module `DbContextBase` +
  `XConfigurationProvider` is the natural filter site. Nothing new at the architecture level.
- **One shared DB, one resolution source.** One `B2BDb`, tenant from one `tenant` claim. No per-tenant
  connection strings, no subdomain/header strategies, no tenant store — none of Finbuckle's distinctive
  machinery applies. (Finbuckle becomes appropriate only if we pivot to a *siloed* product with
  per-tenant databases. If that ever happens it's a cheap bolt-on behind `ITenantContext`, because the
  data model below is identical either way.)
- **Keeps Payment agnostic.** Finbuckle would push tenant-resolution middleware into Payment (a shared
  adapter used by B2B *and* Customer). Plain filters let Payment carry an opaque `TenantId` owner key
  with zero library coupling.

**Key type:** `Guid` — matches `UserId`/`CreatedByUserId` across the codebase; opaque & non-enumerable.
Not `string` (that was a Finbuckle convention, and Finbuckle is out).

---

## 1. Vocabulary (locked)

Layer-split naming — the GitHub/Auth0/Linear/WorkOS pattern. "Tenant" is the code/DB word (consistent,
signals the isolation boundary); "Organization" is purely the user-facing word.

| Concern | Name |
|---|---|
| The tenant row — legal/VAT/Stripe identity; owns venues; the settlement payee | **`TenantEntity`** (PK `Guid Id`), schema `tenant`, module `Concertable.B2B.Tenant.*` |
| Single-owner isolation key + marker | `Guid TenantId` + `ITenantScoped { Guid TenantId { get; } }` |
| Two-party isolation keys | `Guid OperatorTenantId` + `Guid ArtistTenantId` (no single-key marker) |
| Ambient "current tenant" accessor | `ITenantContext` — `Guid? TenantId` + derived `HasTenant` + claim-derived `IsHost`; mirrors `ICurrentUser`, grows later |
| Audit marker (exists) | `IAuditable` |
| Controller / route | `TenantController` serving `[Route("organizations")]` |
| UI copy | "Organization", "Org settings" (operators) / "Business & tax details" (artists) |

There is **no separate tenant-info / resolution DTO** (that was Finbuckle's `ITenantInfo`). The tenant
is just the `TenantEntity` row + the `Guid TenantId` + the `ITenantContext` accessor. Nothing reads an
entity to enforce isolation — the filter compares `row.TenantId == TenantContext.TenantId`.

`TenantEntity` is the existing scaffolded `OrganizationEntity`, renamed and grown. It is the tenant
**root**: keyed by its own `Guid Id`, does **not** implement `ITenantScoped`, does **not** carry a
`TenantId`. Per `MODULAR_MONOLITH_RULES`, every `TenantId` FK is a **plain `Guid` property, never an EF
navigation across module boundaries**.

### Why a `TenantEntity` exists here (some tenant systems have none)

A pure **database-per-tenant** app (each tenant = its own DB; the tenant list in a `ConfigurationStore`
/ Azure App Config) has **no tenant table** — there the tenant is *infrastructure metadata* ("which
connection string?"), so there's nothing to map a table to. Ours is the opposite: the tenant is a
**business/legal entity** whose data (VAT number, Stripe account, registered address, members,
per-tenant config) is user-entered, edited at runtime, and queried for DAC7/settlement/invoicing. That
must live in a queryable table — you can't put a venue's VAT number in `appsettings`. We are shared-DB
row-scoped, deliberately, since per-tenant databases are overkill at our scale.

---

## 2. Entity classification — the investigation result

Three buckets. The dividing question is **whose private management surface does this row belong to** —
*not* "is it ever visible." Public marketplace browse is served by Customer/Search projections, **not**
B2B's tenant-scoped contexts, so scoping B2B's *management* reads does not hide marketplace data.

> **Correction (Phase 2):** the single-owner *read* filter in this bucket was **not** applied — see the Phase 2
> note below. B2B reads these rows from too many cross-party angles (anonymous venue/opportunity pages, an
> artist resolving an opportunity to apply, `Application`/`Booking` joining through `Opportunity`), so a
> single-owner read filter hides rows from people who must see them — the EF "required navigation + filtered
> relative" INNER-JOIN drop — while adding no isolation: in the one-user-per-tenant world these reads are
> already public or `UserId`-keyed. **Bucket-A enforcement in Phase 2 is the write-side interceptor** (stamp +
> block cross-tenant writes). The read filter is deferred to where it earns its keep — multi-user orgs and the
> two-party Bucket B (Phase 4).

### Bucket A — operator-private, single-owner → `ITenantScoped` + `Guid TenantId`, equality filter

`HasQueryFilter("Tenant", e => ctx.IsHost || e.TenantId == ctx.TenantId)`

| Entity | Module | Owner key today | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VenueEntity` | Venue | `Guid UserId` (creating manager) | add `Guid TenantId`; keep `UserId` as creator/audit |
| `VenueImageEntity` | Venue | child of Venue | carry `TenantId` for filter simplicity |
| `OpportunityEntity` | Concert | `int VenueId` | add `Guid TenantId` (= the venue's operator tenant) |
| `ContractEntity` (TPH) | Contract | none (ref'd by `Opportunity.ContractId`) | operator's terms template — add `Guid TenantId` |

### Bucket B — two-party shared → `Guid OperatorTenantId` + `Guid ArtistTenantId`, OR-filter

`HasQueryFilter("Tenant", e => ctx.IsHost || e.OperatorTenantId == ctx.TenantId || e.ArtistTenantId == ctx.TenantId)`

No single-key `ITenantScoped`; the filter is configured **explicitly** in the module's EF config. Both
ids are **denormalized/snapshotted** (§4) — consistent with how `ConcertEntity` already denormalizes
`ArtistReadModel`/`VenueReadModel`, and with the snapshot-at-Accept the legal work needs anyway
(`LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` items 2 & 9).

| Entity | Module | Two-party keys today | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ApplicationEntity` (TPH) | Concert | `ArtistId` + `Opportunity.VenueId` | denormalize both tenant ids at apply |
| `BookingEntity` (TPH) | Concert | via `Application` | inherit both at accept |
| `ConcertEntity` | Concert | `ArtistId` + `VenueId` | denormalize both at draft/accept |
| `ConcertImageEntity` | Concert | child of Concert | scope via Concert |

### Bucket C — cross-tenant / unfiltered (no filter)

Marketplace supply, reference data, identity, infra. Filtering any of these breaks discovery,
projections, or messaging.

| Entity | Module | Why unfiltered |
|---|---|---|
| `ArtistEntity` | Artist | **supply side** — discoverable across all operators. Gets its **own** `Guid TenantId` (the artist's sole-trader legal entity, for VAT/payout) but is **not** filtered. |
| `ArtistReadModel`, `VenueReadModel` | Concert | event-populated denormalized reference; read in the context of already-filtered parents |
| `ArtistRatingProjection`, `VenueRatingProjection`, `ConcertRatingProjection` | Artist/Venue/Concert | public aggregate marketplace data |
| `ArtistReview`, `VenueReview` | Artist/Venue | marketplace data |
| `UserEntity` | User | identity projection (written by `CredentialRegisteredHandler`); user→tenant link is **membership** (later user-model plan), not a row filter |
| `MessageEntity` | Conversations | **provisional** — participant-scoped (`FromUserId == me \|\| ToUserId == me`) today; leaning **tenant-scoped (Bucket B), a group inbox**, deferred to a later user-model plan (see §8). |
| Outbox / Inbox | messaging infra | never scoped |

---

## 3. The mechanism

### 3.1 `ITenantContext` — resolve the current tenant

Interface in `Concertable.Kernel.Identity` next to `ICurrentUser`. For the one-tenant-per-user world, the
B2B implementation resolves the current user's single tenant from `ICurrentUser.Id` via a request-scoped
memoized lookup (the `IContractAccessor` pattern) — no Auth change needed. (A `tenant` *claim* carrying an
*active* tenant is only needed once a user can belong to several tenants and switch — that's the deferred
multi-user work.)

```csharp
public interface ITenantContext
{
    Guid? TenantId { get; }              // current tenant; null = host (no tenant resolved)
    bool HasTenant => TenantId.HasValue; // derived sugar — for guard clauses
    bool IsHost { get; }                 // claim-derived: platform admin or system/service caller — the filter bypass
}
```

**`IsHost` is load-bearing for correctness, and is deliberately NOT just `!HasTenant`.** Event handlers,
workers, the outbox dispatcher, and projection updaters run with **no user → no tenant claim**. If they
ran filtered, `TenantId` would be null and every tenant-scoped query would read/write nothing — silently
breaking projections and settlement, which legitimately cross tenants. So the system/service/worker
principal (no end-user) resolves `IsHost = true` — in scope and needed for those jobs to run. (A
`platform`-admin *human* bypass is a later refinement; admins can use `IgnoreQueryFilters(["Tenant"])`
explicitly until then.)

Why a separate `IsHost` rather than "null tenant ⇒ host": a bug that *drops* the tenant claim off a
normal operator would make `HasTenant == false`. If that alone bypassed the filter, the operator would
read **every** tenant's data. With an explicit claim-derived `IsHost`, a dropped claim yields
`HasTenant == false` **and** `IsHost == false` → the query matches **nothing** (safe failure). `HasTenant`
is only convenience sugar for guard clauses (`if (!ctx.HasTenant) throw …`); it never drives the bypass.

### 3.2 Applying the filters

`ITenantScoped` lives in `Concertable.Kernel` next to `IAuditable` (a bare marker imposes nothing on
services that don't use it). A B2B infrastructure helper applies the single-owner filter to **every**
`ITenantScoped` type, called from each B2B module context's `OnModelCreating` after
`provider.Configure(modelBuilder)`:

```csharp
modelBuilder.ApplyTenantScoping(tenantContext);  // loops entity types implementing ITenantScoped,
                                                  // adds HasQueryFilter("Tenant", e => ctx.IsHost || e.TenantId == ctx.TenantId)
```

`ITenantContext` is injected into each B2B `DbContext` ctor (exactly like the existing
`XConfigurationProvider`). The filter lambda references the context instance member, so EF re-evaluates
it per query.

**Do NOT put this in the shared `DbContextBase`** — that type is cross-service (Customer/Search use it).
The helper + per-context call keeps tenancy a B2B concern.

Two-party (Bucket B) entities get their OR-filter **explicitly** in their module's
`IEntityTypeConfiguration`. The filter name `"Tenant"` is reserved per entity; a future `"SoftDelete"`
filter is a *separate* named filter, toggled independently.

### 3.3 Write-side guard — `TenantInterceptor`

Plain filters protect *reads*; we add a `SaveChangesInterceptor` (modeled on `AuditInterceptor`, same
project) that, on `Added` `ITenantScoped` entities, stamps `TenantId = ctx.TenantId` when unset and
**throws** on a cross-tenant write (`TenantId != ctx.TenantId` for a non-host principal). This recovers
the one ergonomic Finbuckle gives that filters don't — auto-stamp + mismatch protection — in ~30 lines we
already have the pattern for. Two-party rows are stamped by their workflow at Accept, not the interceptor.

### 3.4 Admin / platform bypass

`IgnoreQueryFilters(["Tenant"])` — explicit, greppable, per-query, leaving any other named filter (e.g.
`"SoftDelete"`) intact. Used by platform-admin endpoints and any cross-tenant job not already running as
`IsHost`.

---

## 4. Two-party security — where the tenant ids come from

The two-party rows hold `VenueId`/`ArtistId` ints with no nav across module boundaries, so the filter
cannot traverse to `Venue.TenantId`. The ids are **denormalized at write time**:

- `OpportunityEntity` (Bucket A) is created by the operator → `TenantId` = the venue's operator tenant.
- `ApplicationEntity` (Bucket B) at apply: `OperatorTenantId` = opportunity's operator tenant;
  `ArtistTenantId` = the applying artist's tenant. Both snapshotted onto the row.
- `BookingEntity` inherits both from its `Application` at accept (`AcceptExecutor`).
- `ConcertEntity` carries both from draft/accept.

This snapshot is the **same** frozen-at-Accept data the legal/audit work requires
(`LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` items 2 & 9). Settlement reads the booking snapshot, never live tenant state —
so the isolation predicate and the audit guarantee reinforce each other.

---

## 5. Stripe Connect settlement lifecycle (re-keyed to tenant)

Today the connected account is **per user** (`PayoutAccountEntity.UserId`), provisioned by
`ManagerRegisteredHandler` on `CredentialRegisteredEvent` (filters venue/artist client ids →
`ProvisionCustomerAsync` + `ProvisionConnectAccountAsync(userId, email)`). Settlement moves money between
users (`PayoutFinishStep.PayAsync(venueUserId, artistUserId, …)`, `EscrowEntity.FromUserId/ToUserId`).

The legal posture (`LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` item 0 — Concertable is an **agent**) requires money to move
via the **parties' own connected accounts**, and the payee is the **legal entity** = the tenant:

- **Provision per tenant, not per user.** `TenantProvisioningHandler` (Tenant module) publishes a
  `TenantCreatedEvent` when it creates a tenant; a Payment handler (`TenantCreatedHandler`) provisions the
  Stripe customer + Connect account on that, keyed by the tenant id (Payment's opaque `OwnerId` — see §6).
  `ManagerRegisteredHandler` is **deleted**. One Connect account per tenant (operator *and* artist tenants
  each get one — both send/receive), so the handler now provisions **artist** tenants too (artist tenancy
  partially pulled into Phase 3 — the `TenantEntity` row + `TenantCreatedEvent`, not yet the
  `ArtistEntity.TenantId` linkage, which stays Phase 4).
- **Escrow path** (FlatFee, VenueHire) — `ReleaseEscrowFinishStep → escrowClient.ReleaseByBookingIdAsync`
  transfers held funds to the payee tenant's connected account.
- **Off-session path** (DoorSplit, Versus) — `PayoutFinishStep` reads the booking's frozen party snapshot
  (operator tenant + artist tenant) and pays off-session between their connected accounts.
- Only the **platform fee** is Concertable's revenue; the venue↔artist leg never becomes ours.

---

## 6. Payment service stays agnostic

Payment is a shared adapter (B2B + Customer). It does **not** import `ITenantContext`, named filters, or
any B2B tenancy code — and it must **never learn the word "tenant".** It only renames its **owner key** to
a deliberately neutral `Guid OwnerId`:

| Payment entity | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| `PayoutAccountEntity` | `Guid UserId` (single owner) | `Guid OwnerId` — opaque owner of the Stripe identities |
| `TransactionEntity` (Settlement/Ticket/Verify TPH) | `FromUserId`/`ToUserId` | values become owner ids; field **rename deferred** (see note) |
| `EscrowEntity` | `FromUserId`/`ToUserId` + `BookingId` | values become owner ids; field **rename deferred** (see note) |
| `StripeEventEntity` | — | webhook log; infra; not scoped |

**`OwnerId` is opaque and the *consumer* assigns its meaning** — B2B passes the **tenant** id, Customer
passes the **user** id. Payment has no idea which; it just keys Stripe rows by an owner `Guid`, exactly how
it treated `UserId` today. B2B resolves `venue → operatorTenantId` / `artist → artistTenantId` and passes
them across gRPC; Customer passes the buyer's user id (payer) and the venue's owner id (payee, carried on
`ConcertChangedEvent`). No row-level query filter is added in Payment; it is called with explicit ids, not
serving tenant-scoped browse.

> **Why one `OwnerId`, not two tables (or `TenantId`).** `PayoutAccountEntity` actually welds two Stripe
> identities together: `StripeCustomerId` (the **payer/card** — naturally per-*user*) and `StripeAccountId`
> (the **payout/Connect** account — the **legal entity** = tenant). The clean model splits them along that
> seam (two *composed* entities, **not** a TPH hierarchy — a discriminator would leak EF persistence into the
> adapter's domain). We **defer the split to the multi-user phase**: today it's one-user-per-tenant, so
> `user == tenant` 1:1 for B2B and the split is functionally identical to a single opaque `OwnerId`. It is
> **not a one-way door** — because Payment stays agnostic and a tenant's founding user is recoverable
> (`TenantEntity.CreatedByUserId`), splitting the payer side back out by user later is a Payment-internal
> migration; B2B/Customer keep passing owner ids throughout. Naming the key `OwnerId` (not `TenantId`) is what
> keeps that true: a customer's row is owned by a *user*, and the word "tenant" never enters Payment.
>
> **Deferred (Phase 3):** `EscrowEntity`/`TransactionEntity` keep their `FromUserId`/`ToUserId` field *names*
> for now — their *values* become owner ids (the settlement edges pass owner ids), but a clean rename to
> `From`/`ToOwnerId` ripples through the gRPC-client `EscrowDto` (consumed by B2B/Customer) and E2E SQL, so
> it's a separate low-risk tidy-up (free on the next re-scaffold), not smuggled into this already-wide phase.
> They're opaque participant ids regardless — a ticket payer genuinely *is* a user.

---

## 7. Phases

Each phase ends green (build + tests). Migrations **re-scaffold** via `./initial-migrations.ps1` from
`api/` (per `api/CLAUDE.md` — no additive migrations). No production data, so the nuke is free.

- **Phase 0 — Rename `Organization` → `Tenant`. ✅ Done.** Mechanical: `Concertable.B2B.Organization.*` →
  `Concertable.B2B.Tenant.*`, folder, namespaces, `OrganizationEntity` → `TenantEntity` (PK `int` →
  `Guid`), `OrganizationDbContext` → `TenantDbContext`, `IOrganizationModule` → `ITenantModule`, schema
  `organization` → `tenant`, `AddOrganizationApi/Module` → `AddTenantApi/Module`, `.slnx`, IVT, the
  `initial-migrations.ps1` entry (keeps its 4th slot). Build Web + Workers + tests green.
- **Phase 1 — `ITenantContext` + markers + interceptor. ✅ Done.** `ITenantScoped` (Kernel) +
  `ITenantContext` (Kernel.Identity) + an `ApplyTenantScoping` named-filter helper (EF Core 10 `"Tenant"` filter)
  + `TenantInterceptor` (DataAccess.Infrastructure, modeled on `AuditInterceptor`). *(The read-filter helper was
  dropped in Phase 2 — Bucket-A reads aren't filtered; see the Phase 2 note. The interceptor carries through.)*
  `ITenantContext` impl (`TenantContext`, in the Tenant module; scoped, memoized via `ResolveAsync`)
  resolves the user's single tenant from `ICurrentUser.Id` → `TenantEntity.CreatedByUserId`. `IsHost` =
  **no `HttpContext`** (worker/outbox/handler ⇒ bypass); an anonymous HTTP request keeps `IsHost` false,
  so it fails closed. Plumbing only — **not wired into any context yet**; the resolution trigger
  (request middleware calling `ResolveAsync`) + interceptor wiring land in Phase 2.
  Build + unit tests (tenant / host / anonymous / authenticated-no-tenant) green.
- **Phase 2 — Bucket A: tenant ownership (write-side). ✅ Done.** `TenantId` + `ITenantScoped` on
  `VenueEntity`/`VenueImageEntity`/`OpportunityEntity`/`ContractEntity` (TPH base). Ownership is enforced on the
  **write side** by `TenantInterceptor` (DataAccess.Infrastructure), attached to the Venue/Concert/Contract
  contexts in both hosts: it stamps `TenantId` on insert and throws on a cross-tenant edit at `SaveChanges`;
  domain code never sets it. `ITenantContext` + request middleware (`ITenantResolver`) resolve the current
  tenant per request (the interceptor reads it). Decisions made during the work:
  - **No read query filter.** The §0/§2 single-owner read filter was *not* applied. Bucket-A reads are public
    (anonymous venue/opportunity pages), reference (contracts shown inside opportunities), or `UserId`-keyed
    (operator management), and `Application`/`Booking` join through `Opportunity` — a global single-owner read
    filter dropped those joins (EF required-navigation INNER JOIN) and isolated nothing in the
    one-user-per-tenant world. So reads stay plain; isolation is the write-side interceptor. Read-scoping is
    deferred to where it pays off (multi-user orgs / two-party Bucket B in Phase 4).
  - **`TenantScopedRepository<T>` — the seam, wired but mostly unused.** All three tenant-owned repos extend it
    (`ITenantScopedRepository<T>` in `B2B.DataAccess.Application`, base in `.Infrastructure`). It inherits plain
    CRUD (unscoped) and exposes the opt-in `CurrentTenant` scoped query root + `GetAllByTenantIdAsync(tenantId)`
    (admin/reporting) — the single place scoped-by-default reads get added for multi-user / Phase 4, in now so
    it's a localized change later, not a rewrite. (Named to match `ITenantScoped`; distinct from the Tenant
    module's `TenantRepository`, which is the repo for `TenantEntity` itself.)
  - **`B2B.DataAccess` split into `.Application` + `.Infrastructure`** (mirrors shared `DataAccess`), grouped
    under a `/B2B/DataAccess/` solution folder. `.Application` holds the EF-free `ITenantScopedRepository`;
    `.Infrastructure` holds `TenantScopedRepository` + `ReadDbContext`. Tenancy stays a B2B concern.
  - **Tenants are created for real.** `TenantProvisioningHandler` (Tenant module) provisions a tenant per venue
    manager on `CredentialRegisteredEvent` (idempotent; artist tenants deferred to Phase 4). Seeders create the
    same tenants with a deterministic id derived from the founding user (`TenantSeedIds`), so seeded
    venues/opportunities/contracts carry their owner tenant and the handler no-ops over them; production tenants
    get a random id.
  Migrations re-scaffolded for Venue/Concert/Contract (the only changed models — one `TenantId` column each,
  Contract's on the TPH root). Build green; integration tests green — Venue 25/25 (incl. write-stamps-the-tenant
  + `GetAllByTenantId`) and Concert 59/59.
- **Phase 3 — Re-key payouts to an opaque owner + provision on tenant creation. ✅ Done.** Bigger than first
  scoped: re-keying Payment's *storage* to the tenant forces re-keying its *lookups* too (the key is how
  you find the row), so the "settlement re-key" the plan had pencilled for Phase 4 lands here — Phase 3
  spans **four services** (Auth, B2B, Customer, Payment). Work:
  - **Payment** — `PayoutAccountEntity.UserId → OwnerId` (opaque `Guid`, §6); repo `GetByUserIdAsync →
    GetByOwnerIdAsync`; `IStripeAccountClient.ProvisionX(ownerId, …)`; index + migration re-scaffold.
    Delete `ManagerRegisteredHandler`; add `TenantCreatedHandler : IIntegrationEventHandler<TenantCreatedEvent>`
    (provisions customer + Connect). Keep `CustomerRegisteredHandler` (customer → owner = user id). The gRPC
    proto fields (`payer_id`/`payee_id`) are unchanged in *shape* — they now carry owner ids.
  - **B2B** — new `TenantCreatedEvent` contract (`Concertable.B2B.Tenant.Contracts/Events`, `[MessageType]`);
    `TenantProvisioningHandler` publishes it via the outbox (`IBus.PublishAsync`) **and now creates artist
    tenants too**. Settlement steps (`PayoutFinishStep`, `DepositEscrowAcceptStep`) resolve venue/artist →
    owner (tenant) id before the gRPC call (resolved *live* now; switch to the booking snapshot in Phase 4).
    Subscribe Payment to `event-tenantcreatedevent` (`PaymentTopology`).
  - **Customer** — `ConcertChangedEvent` carries the venue's owner id (operator tenant); Customer's
    `ConcertEntity` projection stores it; `TicketService` passes it as the payee owner.
  - **Auth/identity** — operator/artist token carries an opaque `owner` claim (B2B claims provider sets it to
    the tenant id; Customer's to the user id, else Payment falls back to `sub`); `ICurrentUser`/Payment's
    `StripeAccountController` read it so the **direct-HTTP** self-service endpoints (onboarding-link,
    account-status, payment-method, setup-intent) resolve the owner without a B2B proxy.
  - E2E: `StripeE2EAccountResolver` keys move from seed user ids → seed tenant ids (`TenantSeedIds.For`);
    artist tenants must seed deterministically so the 4 pre-seeded Connect accounts still link and the
    `WaitForPayoutAccountsAsync` 4-account health check stays green. Update mocks + Payment/B2B tests.
  - **Surfaced only by running E2E** (the commit was green-*build* but un-E2E'd): the new `TenantCreatedEvent`
    needs transport registration on both ends — `Publishes<TenantCreatedEvent>` (B2B Web) + `SubscribeTo<>`
    (Payment Workers) — or the outbox row dead-letters / no consumer attaches. The seeder pre-creates tenants,
    so `TenantProvisioningHandler` now **re-announces** an existing tenant (`TenantEntity.Announce`) instead of
    no-op'ing: B2B Web swaps in the *seeding* interceptor during seed (which drops the seed-staged outbox row),
    so the reliable publisher is the live registration handler running on `CredentialRegisteredEvent`. The B2B
    E2E fixture also needed the Tenant module + `TenantInterceptor` registered (a Phase-2 gap the payout timeout
    had masked). For the Customer standalone host (no real B2B), `B2B.Seed.Simulator` now publishes
    `TenantCreatedEvent` too. Seed operators are single-sourced via `SeedUsers.Managers` (a `SeedManager` record
    binding each manager's id/email/kind to its `TenantId`), consumed by Auth's credential seed, `SeedState`,
    and the simulator alike. **Green:** B2B E2E 8/8, Customer E2E 1/1; Concert integration 59/59 (settlement
    payee assertions → owner ids), Venue 25/25, Customer Ticket 15/15; Payment unit 25/25.
- **Phase 4 — Bucket B scoping + snapshot at Accept.** `OperatorTenantId`/`ArtistTenantId` on
  `Application`/`Booking`/`Concert`/`ConcertImage`; populate at apply/accept (`AcceptExecutor`); explicit
  OR-filter in their configs. **Settlement switches from live owner resolution (Phase 3) to reading the
  frozen booking snapshot**, and `ArtistEntity` gets its own `TenantId` (Bucket C). Assert snapshot-at-Accept
  + settlement-reads-snapshot + cross-tenant invisibility of bookings.
- **Phase 5 — Compliance value object on `TenantEntity`** (= `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` item 3): VAT /
  seller identifier / registered address / bank ref as owned value objects. Full round-trip test (nested
  owned types are the main EF risk). Tenant-setup UI hitting `/organizations`.
_(Membership, roles, the authorization sweep, multi-user orgs, and the `MessageEntity` group-inbox
decision are **out of scope** — a later user-model plan owns them. See the scope note at the top.)_

Phases 0–1 are pure plumbing; 2 and 4 turn on the two filter shapes; 3 and 5 are the money/legal
payloads. Each is independently shippable.

## 8. Open product decisions

- **Artist tenancy.** Confirmed: `ArtistEntity` gets its **own** `TenantId` (every artist needs a legal
  entity for VAT/payout) but is **exempt from the filter** (Bucket C) — supply must be cross-tenant
  discoverable.
- **Stripe granularity.** One Connect account **per tenant** (operator and artist tenants alike).
- **`MessageEntity` — deferred to the later user-model plan.** Leaning **tenant-scoped** (a group/shared
  inbox: add `FromTenantId`/`ToTenantId` alongside the existing `FromUserId`/`ToUserId`, visible to any
  member of either tenant — Bucket B). It only comes alive with multi-user membership, so the call is
  parked with that work. Sub-points to settle then: per-user vs per-org `Read` state, and keeping
  notification *routing* separate from message *visibility* (tenant-scoping makes a thread visible to the
  org; who gets pinged is the Notification module's job, not the filter's).
- **Solo operator / solo artist.** An independent venue is an operator tenant with one venue; a solo
  artist is a one-person tenant. No special-casing — both are just tenants.

## 9. Risks

- **`IsHost` resolution for system/worker contexts.** Get it wrong and projections/settlement silently
  no-op (filtered to a null tenant). Covered by an explicit unit test for the service principal.
- **Two-party snapshot completeness.** A missing `OperatorTenantId`/`ArtistTenantId` at write time hides
  the row from its rightful tenant. Snapshot population is a code-review checklist item at every
  apply/accept site.
- **EF nested owned types** (Phase 5 compliance VO) — round-trip test gates downstream work.
- **Filter coverage.** A new Bucket A entity that forgets `ITenantScoped`, or a Bucket B entity that
  forgets its explicit OR-filter, silently leaks. `ApplyTenantScoping` covers Bucket A automatically;
  Bucket B needs a per-entity config audit.

## 10. What this unblocks

- **DAC7 export** — iterate `TenantEntity`, read `Compliance`, emit HMRC schema.
- **Per-contract VAT calc + invoicing** — `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` items 1 → 4 read VAT off the tenant.
- **Cancellation / escrow refund** — item 6 (needs the `Cancelled` state; separate sub-plan).
- **Per-tenant config** — PRS pass-through, platform fee, payment terms, branding hang off the tenant.

## 11. Decision log

- **2026-06-09** — Isolation = **EF Core 10 named query filters**, not Finbuckle. The product is a
  *SaaS-enabled marketplace* (marketplace tenancy): two-party booking/settlement rows Finbuckle's
  one-owner model can't express, plus one shared DB and one claim-based resolution source — so
  Finbuckle's distinctive machinery (per-tenant DBs, resolution strategies, tenant store) is unused while
  `[MultiTenant]` covers only the easy half. Named filters cover both halves with one mechanism; EF Core
  10's independent filter toggling removes the historical "one filter per entity" objection. Reverses the
  2026-06-08 Finbuckle decision.
- **2026-06-09** — Key type **`Guid`** (reverses the Finbuckle-driven `string` choice).
- **2026-06-09** — Naming: code/DB = `TenantEntity`/`TenantId`/`ITenantContext`/`ITenantScoped`; public
  API `/organizations`; UI "Organization". One row (the renamed `OrganizationEntity`), no separate
  tenant-info DTO, no `[MultiTenant]`.
- **2026-06-09** — Ambient accessor is `ITenantContext` (`Guid? TenantId`, derived `HasTenant`,
  claim-derived `IsHost` as the filter bypass). `IsHost` is explicit, not `!HasTenant`, so a dropped
  tenant claim fails safe (sees nothing, not everything). Grows into a memoized gateway to per-tenant
  config later, like `IContractAccessor`.
- **2026-06-09** — Three-bucket entity classification (operator-private / two-party / cross-tenant),
  grounded in the actual entities; system/worker principals resolve `IsHost`.
- **2026-06-09** — Payment stays agnostic: owner key `UserId` → **`OwnerId`** (opaque `Guid`), no B2B
  tenancy code imported. *(Superseded below — keyed `TenantId` originally; corrected to a neutral `OwnerId`.)*
- **2026-06-09 (Phase 3 design)** — Payment's owner key is a neutral **`OwnerId`**, not `TenantId`. The same
  `PayoutAccountEntity` serves ticket-buying **customers** (owned by their *user* id, hold only a
  `StripeCustomerId`) and operators/artists (owned by their *tenant* id). A literal `TenantId` rename would
  store user ids in a column named `TenantId`; a second nullable `TenantId` column would be dead weight on
  every customer row; TPH would leak an EF persistence strategy into the agnostic adapter. So: one opaque
  `OwnerId`, meaning assigned by the **consumer** (B2B → tenant, Customer → user). Payment never learns the
  word "tenant".
- **2026-06-09 (Phase 3 design)** — The clean payer/payout **split** (per-user `StripeCustomerId` vs
  legal-entity `StripeAccountId`) is **deferred to the multi-user phase**. Today `user == tenant` 1:1, so the
  split is functionally identical to one `OwnerId`; it's reversible later (founding user recoverable from
  `TenantEntity.CreatedByUserId`) as a Payment-internal migration, so single `OwnerId` is not a one-way door.
- **2026-06-09 (Phase 3 design)** — Re-keying Payment's storage to the tenant **forces re-keying its lookups
  now** (the key *is* how the row is found). So the settlement re-key (gRPC owner ids; B2B/Customer resolve at
  their edge; `ConcertChangedEvent` carries the venue owner id) moves from Phase 4 into Phase 3; Phase 4
  keeps only the *switch to the frozen snapshot* + Bucket B filter. Operator self-service stays direct-HTTP to
  Payment, resolved via an opaque **`owner` claim** (no B2B proxy, no per-tenant DB switch). Artist tenants
  are created in Phase 3 (row + `TenantCreatedEvent`) so artist Connect provisioning doesn't regress;
  `ArtistEntity.TenantId` linkage stays Phase 4.
- **2026-06-09** — **Scope boundary:** in scope = the isolation mechanism, tenant data model, settlement
  re-key, and **one-tenant-per-user resolution** (so the filters actually work and the app stays
  tenant-isolated — functional, not stubbed). Out of scope = the **multi-user model**: new user types,
  membership, roles, the authorization sweep, multi-tenant switching / active-tenant claim, and the
  `MessageEntity` group-inbox. No new users are introduced; exactly one user per tenant for now.
- **2026-06-09** — Supersedes the Finbuckle `TENANT_PLAN.md` and `TENANCY_DESIGN.md` (both deleted).
