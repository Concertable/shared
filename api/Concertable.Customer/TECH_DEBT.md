### `TicketPurchasedEvent` not consumed by B2B/Search; `TicketRefundedEvent` not published

`TicketPurchasedEvent : IIntegrationEvent` now exists in `Concertable.Customer.Ticket.Contracts` — `TicketEntity.Purchase` raises `TicketPurchasedDomainEvent` (one per ticket), bridged to the bus via the outbox, registered as `Publishes<TicketPurchasedEvent>()` in `Program.cs`. Customer's own Concert module consumes it (`TicketPurchasedHandler` decrements `AvailableTickets`). Still missing from plan §6:

- B2B.Workers does not subscribe — no `ConcertSalesProjection` (sold-count / gross-revenue for dashboards + settlement math).
- Search.Workers does not subscribe — no "X tickets left" counts.
- `TicketRefundedEvent` does not exist (no refund flow yet).

**Resolves when:** B2B.Workers and Search.Workers subscribe and handle (+ their topology subscriptions on `event-ticketpurchasedevent`), and a refund flow publishes `TicketRefundedEvent`.

### E2E boots the whole real fleet from source references (won't survive the repo split)

`Concertable.Customer.E2ETests/AppFixture.cs` launches the Customer AppHost via
`DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder`, composing **real** Payment + Auth + Search through
`Projects.Concertable_*` *source* references. Fine in the monorepo, but it's full-fleet E2E run from
inside one service's repo — it conflates two test tiers and breaks at the repo split. E2E must never
stub Payment (stubbing defeats E2E); the fix is to split tiers by *where they run*:

**Resolves when:**
- **Per-repo (every PR):** Customer keeps only **integration** tests, with adapter services faked
  behind their contracts — Payment via `MockCustomerPaymentClient` against `Payment.Contracts` — plus
  **consumer-driven contract tests**. No Payment source/runtime needed.
- **Full-fleet system E2E (rare / pre-release, centralised):** stands up the real fleet from
  **published container images** (`AddProject<Projects.Concertable_Payment_Web>()` →
  `AddContainer("payment", "<registry>/payment:<version>")`), and moves out of Customer's repo into a
  system/deployment pipeline.

## MED

### Concert detail aggregates via facade fan-out instead of module-local read models

`ConcertService.GetByIdAsync` assembles `ConcertDetail` by loading the concert entity, then calling the Venue/Artist facades (`IVenueModule.GetSummaryAsync` / `IArtistModule.GetSummaryAsync`) via `Task.WhenAll`, with fallback defaults when a summary is missing. B2B's Concert module solves the identical need with **module-local read models** (`VenueReadModel`/`ArtistReadModel` in its own context) joined in a single repo query (`QueryableConcertMappers.ToDetails`) — its service is two lines. Same problem, two architectures; the B2B shape is the canonical one (restricted per-consumer projections).

**Resolves when:** Customer's Concert module owns slice read models in the `[concert]` schema — venue (`Name`, `County`, `Town`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`) and artist (`Name`, `Avatar`, `Rating`, `County`, `Town` + genres child table) — populated by Concert-module handlers for `VenueChangedEvent` / `ArtistChangedEvent` / `ArtistRatingUpdatedEvent` (own inbox rows per consumer); `IConcertReadRepository.GetDetailAsync` does the one-query joined projection; `ConcertService.GetByIdAsync` collapses to `return await concertRepository.GetDetailAsync(id) ?? throw new NotFoundException(...)`; the then-consumerless `IVenueModule`/`IArtistModule` facades are deleted. Requires `./initial-migrations.ps1` re-scaffold and a `ConcertProjectionTestSeeder` extension for the new tables.

### Preference module lacks `.Contracts` project

Concert and Ticket gained their `.Contracts` projects (`IConcertModule`, `ITicketModule`); Preference is the last module without one. No cross-module caller reaches into Preference today, so this is latent.

**Resolves when:** Preference gains a `Concertable.Customer.Preference.Contracts` csproj with `IPreferenceModule` + summary DTOs the moment another module needs it; internal types stay `internal`.

---

### Missing test projects for Artist, Venue, Preference

`Concertable.Customer.Artist`, `Concertable.Customer.Venue`, and `Concertable.Customer.Preference` have no Unit or Integration test projects.

**Resolves when:** Each gains at minimum an Integration tests project following the pattern in `Modules/Review/Tests/` or `Modules/Ticket/Tests/`.

## LOW

### Read repositories don't default to no-tracking

`ConcertReadRepository.GetDtoAsync` needed an ad-hoc `.AsNoTracking()` (EF throws when a projection carries a whole owned instance like `Period` on a tracking query), and the other read repos rely on projections happening to be untracked. Reads through a `ReadRepository<T>` should never track — the per-call opt-out is backwards.

**Resolves when:** the `ReadRepository<T>` base applies `AsNoTracking` to its query root so every derived read repo inherits it, and the ad-hoc call in `ConcertReadRepository` is removed. NOT context-wide `UseQueryTrackingBehavior(NoTracking)` — the projection handlers write through the same module contexts and need tracked queries.

### `TicketDto.UserEmail` is auth-context data threaded through the mapper

`TicketService.GetUserUpcomingAsync` / `GetUserHistoryAsync` pass `currentUser.Email ?? string.Empty` into `tickets.ToDtos(...)`, stamping the caller's own email identically onto every row. Two smells: the email isn't ticket data (the SPA already knows the signed-in user's email from its OIDC session, and `/api/ticket/*/user` endpoints only ever return the caller's tickets), and the `?? string.Empty` masks a missing email claim with empty display data (read-path sibling of the fixed BUG12). Carrying the email through the mapper also forces the load-entities-then-map-in-memory shape — including hauling `QrCode byte[]` blobs for a list view — instead of a `QueryableTicketMappers` projection.

**Resolves when:** `UserEmail` is dropped from `TicketDto` (frontend reads it from its auth state), the list reads become queryable projections (`ToDto()` on `IQueryable<TicketEntity>`, excluding `QrCode` — it has its own fetch path via `GetQrCodeByIdAsync`), and the mapper no longer takes an email parameter.
