# E2E Baseline

The contract for which scenarios are **expected** to pass vs fail. `./e2e.ps1 regress` reads this file to know which scenarios to run; PR review reads it to see what changed.

<!-- ============================================================
     EDITING RULES — the regress script parser depends on these

     ALL data the parser reads lives BELOW the
       <!-- BASELINE-DATA-START -->
     marker further down this file. Anything ABOVE the marker is
     ignored, including this comment.

     Each scenario section MUST be formatted as:

         ### <Suite> <status> (<N>)

         ```text
         scenario name 1
         scenario name 2
         ...
         ```

     - Suite      : "B2B" or "Customer"
     - status     : "passing" or "failing"
     - (<N>)      : MUST equal the line count inside the fenced block
                    parser throws if mismatched
     - Fence      : MUST be ```text (not ``` alone, not ```markdown)
     - One scenario per line. No bullets, no quotes, no leading/trailing whitespace
     - Scenario name MUST exactly match the Reqnroll DisplayName
       (= the Scenario line in the .feature file, no decorations)

     UPDATE FLOW
     When `./e2e.ps1 run` shows a scenario crossing the line (now
     passes that didn't, or now fails that did), move it between
     the passing and failing fenced blocks below AND update both
     (N) counts in the headings AND update the summary table.
     ============================================================ -->

## Summary

Last reconciled: 2026-06-01 / Stripe new-card flows fixed (card-entry viewport + Customer stripe-cli webhook wiring).

| Suite | Total | Passing | Failing |
|---|---|---|---|
| B2B | 23 | 23 | 0 |
| Customer | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| **Total** | **30** | **30** | **0** |

Entire suite green. The previously-failing Stripe payment flows (3DS challenge, "new card" variants, declined-card variants) are fixed: new-card entry now fills the Stripe iframe reliably (tall viewport), and the Customer E2E AppHost now forwards Stripe webhooks via stripe-cli so ticket-purchase confirmation completes.
