### API E2E suites are outside the regress contract; UI scenarios stop at draft creation

Two facts compound into a coverage hole over the back half of the concert lifecycle:

1. [`E2E_BASELINE.md`](./E2E_BASELINE.md) + `./e2e.ps1 regress` track **Reqnroll UI scenarios only**. The four contract workflow features (`FlatFee`/`DoorSplit`/`VenueHire`/`VersusWorkflow.feature`) all end at draft creation + payment-card variants. No scenario posts a concert to the marketplace, finishes one, or settles a deferred contract — so "E2E green" never said anything about post → finish → settle → payout.
2. The API E2E tests that **do** cover that tail — `Concertable.B2B.E2ETests/Payments/ConcertDraftTests.cs` + `ConcertFinishedTests.cs` and `Concertable.Customer.E2ETests/Payments/TicketPurchaseTests.cs` — live in separate xUnit assemblies that no baseline, regress script, or merge gate runs. Unrun tests rot: at current HEAD the DoorSplit/Versus `ConcertFinishedTests` cannot pass (finish dispatches on `concert.DealType`, which production never persisted), and nothing noticed.

Net effect: until the per-contract integration tests added 2026-06-06 (`Concertable.B2B.Concert.IntegrationTests/Concert/Concert*ApiTests.cs`), the post-accept lifecycle had **zero enforced coverage at any test level**. Three production bugs hid there: bookings and concert drafts persisted with `DealType = 0` (FlatFee) so finish/settle dispatched the wrong workflow, and the deferred-contract stage sequence blocked booking settlement outright.

**Resolves when:**

- The API E2E suites join an enforced run contract: either `E2E_BASELINE.md` grows an Api-suite section that `./e2e.ps1 regress` executes (fully-qualified xUnit test names alongside the scenario names), or a parallel api-e2e gate sits in the same merge checklist as the UI regress.
- `ConcertFinishedTests` asserts the per-contract *outcome*, not just intermediate artifacts — for DoorSplit/Versus that means booking `Complete` after the settlement webhook round-trip, not merely that a settlement payment intent exists.
- Until both hold, the integration-level `Concert*ApiTests` are the only finish/settle gate — keep them green.

### E2E stack assumes host prerequisites that only dev machines have

The Aspire E2E stack depends on tooling and config that every dev machine happens to provide but a clean runner does not, and nothing declares or installs them in one place. Each surfaced as a *separate* CI failure, peeled back one at a time (2026-06-15):

1. `appsettings.E2E.json` was gitignored + untracked — the fixtures couldn't even construct on a clean checkout (now tracked, secret-free).
2. The ASP.NET Core HTTPS dev cert — every dev runs `dotnet dev-certs https` once; CI didn't, so Kestrel couldn't bind `https://localhost:708x` (now provisioned + `SSL_CERT_DIR` in the workflow).
3. The `stripe` CLI binary — `AddStripeCli` runs `stripe listen` and Payment Web blocks 60s on its `whsec_` output; the runner had no `stripe` (now installed in the workflow).

This is also why `e2e-api-tests` (merge_group-only, added 2026-05-04) was **0/4 green** — a dev machine was the only environment it had ever run in, so the drift never showed until the queue ran it.

**Resolves when:**

- One provisioning path (a `setup` script or devcontainer) installs/configures the dev cert, the Stripe CLI, Node, etc., and **both** local dev and the CI jobs use it — so "works on my machine" and "works in CI" are the same machine.
- The E2E gate runs often enough (per-PR, not only `merge_group`) that this kind of drift is caught the day it's introduced, not months later.

## MEDIUM

### API E2E AppHosts still launch the frontend SPAs

The B2B/Customer AppHosts add the Vite SPAs (`AddVenueSpa`/`AddArtistSpa`/`AddBusinessSpa`, `AddCustomerSpa`) unconditionally, and the API E2E suites reuse those AppHosts. The API suites are headless (they drive services over HTTP and never open a browser), so the SPAs are dead weight — they `FailedToStart` in CI (no Node) and used to be awaited via `WaitForAllServingAsync`, which was removed 2026-06-15. They still sit in the resource graph as failed resources.

**Resolves when:**

- The API E2E composition (`AddB2BE2E` / `AddCustomerE2E`) strips the `NodeAppResource` SPA resources, so the headless API stack doesn't launch frontends at all — mirroring how `AddEphemeralSql` tailors the dev AppHost for testing.

### WORKAROUND — 12-minute E2E health wait covers slow demo-user seeding

> Workaround, not a fix. Tagged `// WORKAROUND` at the call site
> (`Concertable.B2B`/`Concertable.Customer` `AppFixture.WaitForAllHealthyAsync`). Remove when the
> resolution below lands; until then every E2E run pays the inflated wait.

The 71 demo users are created one `CredentialRegisteredEvent` at a time (Auth registers a credential → outbox → ASB → B2B/Customer handler → insert user). On the CI runner's ASB emulator this reached only ~53/71 in 6 minutes, so the health wait — which gates on the `users` check — was bumped to 12 min (2026-06-15).

**Resolves when:**

- The credential seed is fast enough to finish well inside a 6-minute budget — e.g. tighten the outbox/inbox dispatch interval for the E2E environment, or batch the credential registration — at which point the timeout reverts to 6 and this entry is deleted.
